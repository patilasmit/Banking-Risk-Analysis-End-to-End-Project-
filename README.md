## üîß Project Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Connection & Collection
- Data pulled directly from **Snowflake** to Python and Power BI

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Dropped nulls & unnecessary IDs
- Transformed and renamed columns for readability

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visuals: Age, Risk, Income, Credit Cards

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering (KMeans)
- Clustered customers by:
  - Estimated Income
  - Credit Card Balance
  - Bank Loan Amount
  - Risk Weighting
- Created customer personas to target with banking products

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Power BI Dashboard (4 Pages)
- **Loan Analysis**  
- **Deposit Insights**  
- **Home Metrics (KPIs)**  
- **Summary Page** for business decisions
